# Neurons

Each Neuron has a weight factor w = (w_1, w_2, ...., w_n),  where n is the number of inputs to that neuron.

So what does a neuron do?
It takes the inputs and multiplies them by their weights,
then it sums them up,
after that it applies the activation function to the sum.

# Activation Functions
Used to normalize the output of a neuron.
